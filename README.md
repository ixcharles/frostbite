### Realistic Cold Exposure in Minecraft
**Frostbite** brings the harsh cold of Minecraft's icy biomes to life! When players venture into frigid regions like snowy tundras or frozen peaks, they’ll experience debilitating effects like slowness, hunger, and even take periodic cold damage unless they’re properly protected. With deep customization, you can tweak every aspect to fit your server's survival or RPG mechanics!

## Features
### **❄️ Core Mechanics:**

- **Cold Biome Detection** – Detects when players enter predefined cold biomes (like Snowy Tundra, Frozen Ocean, etc.).

- **Frozen Effects** – Applies configurable effects: Slowness, Hunger, etc...

- **Periodic damage (customizable)**

- **Chill Timer** – Effects apply gradually, with a cooldown to simulate increasing exposure.

### 🧣 Protection Mechanisms:

- **Leather Armor** – Allow specific number of leather armor to negate cold effects.

- **Fire Protection Enchantments** – Wear a number of enchanted armor with fire protection to stop the freezing effect.
