### Realistic Cold Exposure in Minecraft
**Frostbite** brings the harsh cold of Minecraft's icy biomes to life! When players venture into frigid regions like snowy tundras or frozen peaks, they’ll experience debilitating effects like slowness, hunger, and even take periodic cold damage unless they’re properly protected. With deep customization, you can tweak every aspect to fit your server's survival or RPG mechanics!
